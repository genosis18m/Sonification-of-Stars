# Image Sonification: Let's Hear the Galaxies!

## Abstract

Ever wondered what a galaxy sounds like? This project takes images of galaxies and turns them into sound! We'll use Python tools like OpenCV and NumPy to work with the images, figure out the colors, and then make those colors into something you can hear.

## Project Description

This project has code that can:

-  Load pictures of galaxies from a special file.
-  Figure out the colors in each picture.
-  Show the galaxy pictures so we can see them.
-  Save the color information for later.
-  Turn the color information into different kinds of pictures to help us understand it better.

## Project Structure

- **data/:** This is where the galaxy pictures are stored.
- **.ipynb:**  These are like digital notebooks where we write and run our code.
- **output/:**  This is where we save the color information and any pictures we create.
